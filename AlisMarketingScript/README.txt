INSTRUCTIONS

First, you'll need to have downloaded Python3 if you don't have it installed.
You can do so here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
Python3 is a version of Python, a popular scripting programming language. It's safe, and you might already have it on your computer
When installing, the defaults are probably fine. Just make sure to associate '.py' with Python if it asks

You'll need to finish filling in the data for the 'websites.csv' file.

MAKE SURE TO FOLLOW THE HEADER AND PUT DATA IN THE CORRECT COLUMNS.


To run the program, just run 'script.py'.
The script should auto run when double clicked. If not, right click and select run.

An output window will pop up, the script will scrape the websites and output the results to a bunch of '.csv' files.

You can run the script whenever you want, it will append a new row to each '.csv'. 

NOTE
If you edit and of the output csv's in their original form, the program won't respond. So don't reorder columns or insert charts - copy the file and make changes on the copy.

Excel will probably ask you everytime you save to save the '.csv's' in an excel format. Don't. Changing the extension will break things.
