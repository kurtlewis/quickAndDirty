#My MLH Registration Script

In prepping for RevUC, it turns out [my.mlh.io](https://my.mlh.io) (Major League Hacking's registration system) does not track when user's have registered for your event. Furthermore, their list is entirely unordered. We needed to send out an email to all who had registered since our initial welcome email. I wrote this quick script to clean up a list of who we had sent our email to, and remove them from the list of total registrants, leaving only those who had not yet recieved an email.
